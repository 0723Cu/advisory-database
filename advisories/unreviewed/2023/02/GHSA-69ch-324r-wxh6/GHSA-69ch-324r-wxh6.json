  "summary": "Butterfly Button confidential data disclosure",
  "details": "Butterfly Button plugin leaves trace evidence of its use on user's device.\n\nThe Butterfly Button is designed to allow for a confidentials means for those undergoing spousal abuse to reach out for help without leaving evidence of browsing dedicated sites by offering code to be embedded in unrelated 3rd party sites such as banks.\n\nThe Butterfly Button has been found to fail in its intended goal:\n1. Domain name\n  1.1. All implementations of the Butterfly Button make calls to a unique domain name only used by the Butterfly Button\n  1.2. The domain name indicates what it hosts and is also browsable revealing what it offers\n  1.3. The domain name is not accessed unless the Butterfly Button is activated by a user which makes the malicious discovery process \n  simple to use in verification of their victim calling for help\n2. Once the Butterfly Button is initiated uniquely common and identifiable resources are stored locally by the browser",
