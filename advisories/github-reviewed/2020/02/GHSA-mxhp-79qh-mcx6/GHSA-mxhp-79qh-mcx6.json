  "summary": "TaffyDB can allow access to any data items in the DB",
  "details": "Update:\n\nLowering the severity level.\n\nTLDR: The ___id value on TaffyDB records provides no privileged access to anyone who does not already have necessary access to the TaffyDB data loaded into memory or to the unprotected (or unvalidated) backend/SQL APIs for storage. Data loaded into a TaffyDB should be trusted at the same level as any other data loaded from a JSON service (or local storage API) and data stored from a TaffyDB table should be trusted at the same level as data from any other API, get, or form post.  \n\nOriginal:\nTaffyDB allows attackers to forge adding additional properties into user-input processed by taffy which can allow access to any data items in the DB. Taffy sets an internal index for each data item in its DB. However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, TaffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB. **Note:** `taffy` and its successor package `taffydb` are not maintained.\n\n\n\n",
